# Advent of code 2022

## WTF even is this?
I'm glad you've asked!   
This, my dear reader, is my attempt on finishing my first coding challenge in my life as well as documentary of my mental breakdown doing it.   
   
Did you come to see great and optimized solutions? Well then, you migh be better off leaving, however, if you want to see some messed up shit, you are on the right address! So strap in and dig in!   
   
## How to run?
Use node - and then just run files like `node dayX.js`.   
I'm planning on improving the input loading to be a separate file that can be replaced using command line args, but so far I've been to lazy to do that.
